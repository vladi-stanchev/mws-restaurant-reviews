TODO

* Map to be accessible with tabs but not right after the navigation. so you can apply the ‘skip to main content’ logic
* OK Tabindex
* Sort out colours and simplify scheme - use hex where possible
* Change #ids css selectors to .classes
* Define headings only once globally
* Custom pins for map (pink)
* Check if there is a better way to structure css for mobile-first approach - main css is for mobile only and expanding happens in MQs
* Compress webp images further
* Introduce <srcset> to use optimised images and both webp and jpg
